## What is Beta Testing?

As a beta tester, you're using a **pre-release version** of Minalesh Marketplace. This means:

✅ **You get early access** to new features before the public
✅ **Your feedback shapes the product** - we listen and iterate based on what you tell us
✅ **You help make it better** - by reporting bugs and suggesting improvements
⚠️ **Some features may be incomplete** - we're still refining the experience
⚠️ **Occasional bugs may occur** - that's why we need your help to find them!

Your participation is invaluable in making Minalesh the best marketplace for Ethiopian users.

## Providing Feedback

Your feedback is crucial! Here's how to help:

4. Click **Submit**

**What makes a good bug report:**
- ✅ Clear title and description
- ✅ Steps to reproduce the bug
- ✅ Screenshots if visual issue
- ✅ What browser/device you're using
- ❌ Don't just say "it doesn't work"
- ❌ Don't report the same bug multiple times

   - How should it work?
4. Click **Submit**

**Example good feature request:**
> **Title**: Add favorite vendors
> 
> **Description**: I shop regularly from 2-3 vendors. It would be great to have a "Favorite Vendors" list so I can quickly see their new products and special offers. Maybe a heart icon next to vendor names to save them?
